# Spring-Security-Bootstrap
Applying Spring security to the login page.
I have created a custom login page using Bootstrap framework. Once the user tries to access the protected resource they will be 
redirected to the login page. Once they are authenticated, spring security framework will look for authorization such as the roles they 
perform in an organization. Depending on his role special pages or links will be provided.
